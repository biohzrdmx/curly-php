curly-php
=========

Easy to use, general purpose CuRL wrapper

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/curly-php` with Composer.

Now get an instance of `Curly`, prepare your request and execute it:

```php
use Curly\Curly;

$curly = Curly::newInstance()
  ->setMethod('GET')
  ->setURL('https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random')
  ->setParams([ 'limitTo' => 'nerdy' ])
  ->execute();
```

Once executed you'll need to call the `getResponse` method to retrieve the `Response` object and use the data for whathever you like:

```php
$response = $curly->getResponse();
if ($response && $response->getStatus() == 200) {
  $body = $response->getBody();
  if ($body->type == 'success') {
    echo $body->value->joke;
  }
} else {
  echo 'API error: ' . $curly->getError();
}
```

It's important to note that `getBody` will parse `JSON` and `XML` payloads if the response has a valid `Content-Type` header, but you may disable that by passing `true` as the first parameter to get a `raw` response body;

Also if the request fails you may call `getError` or `getInfo` to find the cause of the failure.

The `Response` object can also retrieve the value of a single header with the `getHeader` method or all the response headers via the `getHeaders` one.

As this internally uses the `curl` extension, it supports `HTTPS` out of the box if you have a properly configured server, but you may specify the location of you CA bundle by passing it as the first parameter in the `newInstance` call:

```php
$cainfo = '/absolute/path/to/cacert.pem';
$curly = Curly::newInstance($cainfo);
```

Just grab a copy of `cacert.pem` [from here](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) and pass its absolute path. Curly will automatically honor your `php.ini` if its properly set there.

#### Downloading files

Starting from version 2.2 it's possible to stream file downloads directly to a file handle, to do so you will need to pass a resource before executing the request:

```php
$resource = fopen('/absolute/path/to/file.zip', 'wb');
if ($resource) {
  $curly = Curly::newInstance()
    ->setMethod('GET')
    ->setResource($resource)
    ->setURL('https://my-web-app.com/assets/file.zip')
    ->execute();
  $response = $curly->getResponse();
  fclose($resource);
}
```

In this case the file data is written directly to the resource, so `$response->getBody()` will return an empty string, but you can check the status with `$response->getStatus()` and get the corresponding headers with `$response->getHeader()` and `$response->getHeaders()`.

Remember to always close the file with `fclose`;

#### Uploading files

Also, there's support for file uploads with the `CURLFile` class,

```php
use CURLFile;

$avatar = new CURLFile('/absolute/path/to/avatar.png');
$curly = Curly::newInstance()
  ->setMethod('POST')
  ->setURL('https://my-web-app.com/api/users/profile')
  ->setFields( ['email' => 'foo@bar.baz', 'avatar' => $avatar] )
  ->execute();
```

Just add your files like any other field and set the request method to `POST`, the class adjust everything automatically.
